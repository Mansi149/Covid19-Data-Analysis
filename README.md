# COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python

SKILLS :- Python Programming, Data Analysis, Pandas, Seaborn, Statistics

In this project, I learnt how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. 
In this project, I worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day,
in each Country. Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  
We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

Steps I followed :-

-> Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

-> Deciding on and calculating a good measure for our analysis.

-> Merging two datasets and finding correlations among our data.

-> Visualizing our analysis results using Seaborn.

#### All the graphs are also added in this repository.
#### This data is not accurate as the number of cases are not certain and may vary with the actual data, this project was performed for the sole purpose of learning.
